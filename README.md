# Noise Suppression (for Lethal Company)

Sick of hearing your friends' mouth noises when you're being chased by a bracken? \
Would you rather not listen to your mate's TikToks while he's "watching the monitors" back at the ship? (yes, I'm talking about you Eugene ðŸ‘¿)

Listen no more with the NoiseSuppression mod!

As it turns out, the underlying audio engine has support for RNNoise noise suppression, so this mod simply turns it on.

## Compatability

This has been tested with the following Lethal Company versions, but it'll most likely work with future versions unless the backend audio engine changes.

 - v40
 - v45

## How to use

Once you've installed the mod, you can change your suppression state using the following keys:

- `0`: toggle noise suppression on/off
- `PageUp`: enable noise suppression
- `PageDown`: disable noise suppression
- `8`: decrease the "wet mix" of microphone audio into suppressed audio by 10%
- `9`: increase the "wet mix" of microphone audio into suppressed audio by 10%

## Installation

Same as every other project:

- Thunderstore
- Manual, just drop the DLL into the plugins dir

I may be a .NET developer, but Unity's engine code is an unknown to me so who knows if I'm doing stuff correctly :D

You'll need to copy the following DLLs out of your game directory (`Lethal Company/Lethal Company_Data/Managed`) into the `/lib` directory of this solution

- `Assembly-CSharp.dll`
- `DissonanceVoip.dll`
- `Unity.InputSystem.dll`
- `Unity.Netcode.Runtime.dll`
- `UnityEngine.dll`
