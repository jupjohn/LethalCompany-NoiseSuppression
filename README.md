# Noise Suppression (for Lethal Company)

Sick of hearing your friends' mouth noises when you're being chased by a bracken? \
Would you rather not listen to your mate's TikToks while he's "watching the monitors" back at the ship? (yes, I'm talking about you Eugene ðŸ‘¿)

This has been tested with the following Lethal Company versions, but it'll most likely work with future versions unless the backend audio engine changes.

 - v40
 - v45

## Installation

Same as every other project

- Thunderstore
- Manual
